# Tournament Display Panel

This project provides a web-based display system for managing and viewing tournament information, including player rosters, round pairings, and a round timer. It is designed to be run locally or deployed easily via GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **Control Panel (`index.html`):** A central hub to launch the different display screens.
- **Roster Display (`roster.html`):** An auto-scrolling display for the list of registered players, categorized by division (Júnior, Sénior, Máster).
- **Pairings Display (`pairings.html`):** An auto-scrolling display for round pairings, showing table number, player names, and opponent names.
- **Timer (`timer.html`):** A full-screen countdown timer for rounds, with a configurable duration and an audible alarm.

## How to Use

### Data Files

The displays are driven by HTML report files generated by tournament software (like TOME).

- **Roster File:** The roster display (`roster.html`) expects a file like `jnknnjroster.html`.
- **Pairings File:** The pairings display (`pairings.html`) expects a file like `jnknnjpairings.html`.

You can change the files used by editing the filenames in the `index.html` control panel before launching a display.

### Missing Assets

To get the full experience, you need to add the following files to this `docs/` directory:

- `fredyparty-logo.png`: The logo displayed at the top of each screen.
- `timer-alarm.mp3`: The sound that plays when the timer reaches zero.
- `main.css`: A stylesheet referenced by the data files (`jnknnjroster.html` and `jnknnjpairings.html`).

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This project is ready for deployment on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:** Create a new repository on your GitHub account.

2.  **Push the Project:**
    - Place this `docs` folder inside your local repository folder.
    - Commit and push the `docs` folder to your GitHub repository.

3.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    - In your repository on GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    - Under "Build and deployment", select the **Source** as **Deploy from a branch**.
    - Set the **Branch** to `main` (or `master`) and the folder to `/docs`.
    - Click **Save**.

4.  **Access Your Site:**
    - GitHub will provide you with a URL (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`).
    - It may take a minute or two for the site to become live. The control panel will be at the root of that URL.
