## Features

- **Control Panel (`index.html`):** A central hub to launch the different display screens.
- **Roster Display (`roster.html`):** An interactive display for the list of registered players. It features auto-scrolling through categories (Júnior, Sénior, Máster) and also allows for manual filtering by category and searching for specific players.
- **Pairings Display (`pairings.html`):** An interactive display for round pairings. It auto-scrolls through categories, showing table number and player names. It also includes controls to filter by category and search for a specific player or table number.
- **Timer (`timer.html`):** A full-screen countdown timer for rounds, with a configurable duration and an audible alarm.

## How to Use

### Data Files

The displays are driven by HTML report files generated by tournament software (like TOME). The default filenames for these reports are `roster-latest.html` and `pairings-latest.html`.

The control panel (`index.html`) allows you to specify different filenames before launching a display. The display pages (`roster.html` and `pairings.html`) also include interactive controls to search and filter the data, providing more flexibility than the auto-scrolling view.
